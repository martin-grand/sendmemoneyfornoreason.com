                <h1>Send me money for no reason!</h1>
                <a class="button" data-answer="why">Why?</a>
                <p>Why? It's not a necessary question.. For no reason. If I tell you why you would get a reason to send
                    me money. In that case, <a href="//sendmemoneyfornoreason.com">sendmemoneyfornoreason.com</a> is not
                    a valid domain name anymore.</p>
                <p>Just sit down. Relax, close your eyes, and start focusing on the universe. Just listen to it. What
                    does it telling you? Is that something like "Okay, just send some money to this dude"? In that case,
                    just send me money.</p>
                <div data-answer-block="not">
                    <a class="button" data-answer="not">The universe is not telling me that.</a>
                    <p>You really tried it? If yes, and not heard, no problem. Just ask your self why are you here in
                        <a href="//sendmemoneyfornoreason.com">sendmemoneyfornoreason.com</a> and learn something from
                        it. If you haven't tried, just try it! Really! Just sit down. Relax, close your eyes, and start
                        focusing on the universe.</p>
                    <div data-answer-block="reallynot">
                        <a class="button" data-answer="reallynot">I really don't hear that voice.</a>
                        <p>A scientific study points to that, a human doesn't need a real reason to spend money.
                            I'm giving you the feeling of spending money for free. I mean not for free, but for how much
                            do you want to feel it.</p>
                        <div data-answer-block="study">
                            <a class="button" data-answer="study">What scientific study?</a>
                            <p>I don't know. Must it be a scientific study? Is it really necessary? Okay, I don't know
                                an exact scientific study about that. But it should be. Because you can say that, I have
                                no enough effort to this grateful
                                <a href="//sendmemoneyfornoreason.com">sendmemoneyfornoreason.com</a>,
                                I have been created an infographic about it. It can be even a scientific study:</p>
                            <p><img src="./i/illustration.svg" title="awesome info graphic"/></p>
                            <div data-answer-block="no">
                                <a class="button" data-answer="no">I don't want to send you money for no reason!</a>
                                <p>Never mind. It's absolutely normal. You are not crazy. You don't have to feel bad
                                    because of it. It's really just a decision. There are some other dudes on the
                                    planet, who decided the same way. I can't prove it. But I'm pretty sure about
                                    that.</p>
                                <p>If you really want some proof like stuff, I can show you another awesome infographic
                                    about that:</p>
                                <p><img src="./i/illustration-2.svg" title="awesome info graphic 2"/></p>
                                <div data-answer-block="nogap">
                                    <a class="button" data-answer="nogap">I don't want be a reason of this gap!</a>
                                    <p>Never mind. It's absolutely normal. You are not crazy. To be afraid of inflicting a gap is our human nature.</p>
                                    <p>I assure you that if you sending me money, you will not be a reason for this gap. In that case, you reduce that.</p>
                                    <p>Reducing a gap means power. If you reduce that gap, you belong to powerful people.</p>

                <h2>Thank you!</h2>
                <p>It means a lot to me. I appreciate it. Don't do it for me! Keep in mind when you pay: for no reason.</p>
