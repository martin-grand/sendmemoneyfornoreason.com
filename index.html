                <h1>Send me money for no reason!</h1>
                <a class="button" data-answer="why">Why?</a>
                <p>Why? It's not a necessary question. For no reason. If I tell you why you would get a reason to send me money. In that case, <a href="//sendmemoneyfornoreason.com" title="Send me money for no reason!">sendmemoneyfornoreason.com</a> is not a valid domain name anymore.</p>
                <p>Just sit down. Relax, close your eyes, and start focusing on the universe. Just listen to it. What does it telling you? Is that something like "Okay, just send some money"?</p>
                <div data-answer-block="not">
                    <a class="button" data-answer="not">The universe is not telling me that.</a>
                    <p>You really tried it? If you haven't tried, just try it! Really! Just sit down. Relax, close your eyes, and start focusing on the universe.</p>
                    <div data-answer-block="reallynot">
                        <a class="button" data-answer="reallynot">I really don't hear that voice.</a>
                        <p>A scientific study points to that, a human doesn't need a real reason to spend money. I'm giving you the feeling of spending money for free. I mean not for free, but for how much do you want to feel it.</p>
                        <div data-answer-block="study">
                            <a class="button" data-answer="study">What scientific study?</a>
                            <p>Must it be a scientific study? Is it really necessary? Okay, I don't know an "exact" scientific study about that. But it should be! To show some effort to this grateful <a href="//sendmemoneyfornoreason.com" title="Send me money for no reason!">sendmemoneyfornoreason.com</a>, I have been created an infographic about it. It can be even a scientific study:</p>
                            <p><img src="./i/illustration.svg" title="awesome infographic"/></p>
                            <div data-answer-block="no">
                                <a class="button" data-answer="no">I don't want to spend money for no reason!</a>
                                <p>Never mind. It's absolutely normal. You are not crazy. You don't have to feel bad because of it. It's really just a decision. There are some other dudes on the planet, who decided the same way. I can't prove it, but I'm pretty sure about that.</p>
                                <p>If you really want some proof, I can show you another awesome infographic about that:</p>
                                <p><img src="./i/illustration-2.svg" title="awesome infographic 2"/></p>
                                <div data-answer-block="nogap">
                                    <a class="button" data-answer="nogap">I don't want to be a reason for this gap!</a>
                                    <p>To be afraid of inflicting a gap is our human nature. I assure you that if you sending me money, you will not be a reason for this gap. In that case, you reduce that. Reducing a gap means power. If you reduce that gap, you belong to powerful people.</p>
                                    <div data-answer-block="know">
                                        <a class="button" data-answer="know">I want to know who will receive my money!</a>
                                        <p>I'm <a href="http://martingrand.com/" target="_blank">Martin Grand</a>. A happy person, with a wonderful life, and there is a lot of more people who need the money more than I! After I realized how many of us spend money for no real reason, I wanted to open the doors for the possibility to spend those values for good reasons and also wanted to hold a curved mirror to the society.</p>
                                        <p>So I decided to run my brand new fancy website: <a href="//sendmemoneyfornoreason.com" title="Send me money for no reason!">sendmemoneyfornoreason.com</a>. It was hard to create. It was a serious 10£ investment for the domain name and took more than 2 ruthless hours to build it from the ground.</p>
                                        <p>So the decision is up to you. If you really want to spend money for nothing, for no reason, I give you this opportunity right here, right now. But if you want to help me, just look around, and help someone else who really needs your help!</p>

                <h2>Thank you! ❤</h2>
                <p>It means a lot to me. I appreciate it. Don't do it for me! Keep in mind when you pay: for no reason.</p>
